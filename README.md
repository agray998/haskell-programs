# Haskell-programs

This repository contains Haskell programs written while learning the language:
* helloworld.hs simply prints "Hello World" to the screen
* oneplustwo demonstrates simple arithmetic
* fizzbuzz.hs plays the traditional classroom game 'FizzBuzz', printing "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5 and the number itself for any number which is a multiple of neither
* bottles.hs prints the lyrics to '99 bottles of beer on the wall' using a loop
* caesar.hs encrypts a string using the Caesar Cipher, and applies a cipher-cracking function to decrypt it again
